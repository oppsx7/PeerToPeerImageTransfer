# What is this ?

This is a simple implementation of the Multipeer Connectivity framework, in order to show how a number of devices can communicate between themselves when they are nearby.
The app can advance and transfer different data, but is limited to only images just for the task.

#How to open ?
It should be buildable right when you open it in XCode from the .xcodeproj file.
